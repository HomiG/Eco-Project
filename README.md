# Eco-Project


Web Project in NodeJS - Express

Using NodeJS, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery we have developed a web application that visualizes on a heatmap the movement of a userâ€™s Google Map Takeout on a user-friendly interface. A user can get informed about the statistics of his movement (walking, running, on vehicle etc.) in Patras. The application has a basic log in system that supports encryption and a basic authentication  and authorization system.
